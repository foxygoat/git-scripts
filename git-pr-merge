# Merge and update branches for GitHub Pull Requests (PRs).
#
# Usage: git <pr-merge|pr-update>
#
# git pr-merge
# ------------
# Merge the current "feature" branch into the base "master" branch and push
# to GitHub, closing the PR.
#
# GitHub allows you to push a merge commit on a branch even when that branch is
# protected, if that commit is the result of merging a PR and that PR is
# suitable to be merged (all required checks have been satisfied, the required
# number of approvals are present, the branch is up-to-date WRT the target
# branch, etc). This feature allows you to operate from the command line
# instead of needing to use the GitHub web-ui to merge and close a PR.
#
# git pr-update
# -------------
# Update the current "feature" branch by merging the base "master" branch
# into it, ready for merging with "git pr-merge".
#
# If you have "Require branches to be up-to-date" on branch protection, you
# cannot merge a PR if the base "master" branch has moved on from where the
# feature branch was branched from master. The GitHub UI has an "Update Branch"
# button that merges master into the branch, which gets it up-to-date from the
# base branch, but the merge commit added to the branch is a "back merge". If
# that is fast-forward merged into master, you end up with a "foxtrot" merge
# where the first parent is the feature branch, not the master branch, breaking
# `git log --first-parent`. If you do a merge commit back into master, you end
# up with merges going back and forth between master and feature branches,
# making a mess of your history. Neither is ideal.
#
# When run as "git pr-update", this script will create a merge commit from
# master on the head of the feature branch, but that commit will have the
# correct order of parents and a complete merge commit message such that it
# can be fast-forward merged into master. This will allow CI to run on the
# result of merging master as the branch will be up-to-date, but no foxtrot
# or criss-cross merges will occur. If the head commit is already a merge
# commit from this script, it will be removed before re-merging so as to
# not have a bunch of unnecessary merges.
#
# Requirements
# ------------
# This scripts relies on the github `hub` tool to retrieve information about
# the merge branch PR. It will fail if not installed. Install it from
# https://github.com/github/hub.

  # necessary to not have GitHub show the commits on master on the PR. You

  # put there, prepare the branch by removing it, so there is only ever one
